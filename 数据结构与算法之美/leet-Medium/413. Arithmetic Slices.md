Description:

A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, these are arithmetic sequence:
```
1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
```
The following sequence is not arithmetic.

1, 1, 2, 5, 7

A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A slice of that array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 <= P < Q < N.

A slice (P, Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:
A[P], A[p + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that P + 1 < Q.

The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A.


Example:

A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.

Solution:
等差数列
规定：子数列的长度最少为3
且在原数组中是连续出现的子序列
连续的等差数列有n个元素的时候，则会有(1+2+...+(n - 2))个等差子数列

f[i]表示到当前位置的切片数
状态方程：f[i]=f[i-1]+i

```java
public int numberOfArithmeticSlices(int[] A) {
    if (A == null || A.length < 3) return 0;
    int res = 0;
    
    int[] f = new int[A.length];
    for (int i = 1; i < A.length - 1; i++) {
        if (A[i] - A[i - 1] == A[i + 1] - A[i]) {
            f[i] = f[i - 1] + 1;
        }
        res += f[i];
    }
    
    return res;
} 
```
